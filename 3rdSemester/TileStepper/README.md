# TileStepper

Now imagine a NxN matrix. This bug makes a random move and doesn't stop until it visits all "tiles". Here N is given by the user. 
It's a seemingly boring university task but I wanted to test different sizes and different starting positions. Turns out, it takes less moves to traverse all matrix
when the bug starts from a corner. It takes more moves when it starts in the middle of the matrix. Writing that simulation with different sizes and starting points
and recording them in a text file was enjoyable.
