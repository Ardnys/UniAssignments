# ThePriorityQueue

Another University task but one cannot help but appreciate a brilliant algorithm. Perhaps my MinHeap implementation isn't really nice but I wanted to code my own solution.

# Code 

This is actually a benchmark test-ish project. It's comparing different priority queue implementations; namely MinHeap, sorted Array List, and Linked List. 
Unsurprisingly, MinHeap slaps. It's a massive dopamine hit and I am all for it :D
