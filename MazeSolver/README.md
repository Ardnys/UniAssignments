# MazeSolver

Given a maze of 0s and 1s (0s are paths and 1s are borders) this algorithm finds all possible valid paths, that is it starts from upper left corner and ends at
lower right corner. It teaches the concepts of stacks and backtracking. 

I enjoy working on algorithms like this although it's quite difficult sometimes. My other unrelated challenge was the fact that I was very ill when I did this
thus the weird function and variable names and comments. I didn't fix it for the laughs. 

There were a lot of points where I could have done things differently. I tried to do that with TileStepper, which is given after this one. 

# Important Note

This algorithm isn't really good with wide paths. By not really good i mean it tries every single imaginable combination of paths and it takes ages to finish 
In fact, i don't even know how long it takes. It may need some optimization for those.
