Oh, Liege waffles, how do I adore
The way you satisfy my sweet tooth's core
With your crisp, caramelized outside
And fluffy, chewy insides that I can't hide

Your pearl sugar pockets burst with flavor
As I savor each bite with delicious fervor
Golden brown and dusted with powdered snow
You are the perfect treat, a heavenly show

Your aroma wafts through the air
Drawing me near, as if I were in your lair
And as I take a bite, I'm transported
To a world where happiness can't be thwarted

Liege waffles, oh how divine
You make my taste buds dance and shine
I'll always come back for more
For you, my love, are the one I adore.
